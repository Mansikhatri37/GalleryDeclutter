# Gallery Declutter

## 📌 Overview
Gallery Declutter is an innovative web application designed to help users organize and clean up their gallery in a fun and engaging way. Users can upload images to the platform, where they can review and decide whether to keep or delete them. Additionally, the app categorizes images into different types such as documents, trash (empty images), and blurred images for easier management.

## ✨ Features
- **Image Upload & Declutter**: Users can upload their images and review them for deletion or retention.
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically classifies uploaded images into categories like Documents, Blurred Images, and Trash.
- **Gamification**: Users can track their decluttering streaks and achievements.
- **Quick Action Buttons**: Swipe or tap to quickly manage images.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensures smooth browsing through uploaded images.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (for web application UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js (for handling image processing and analytics)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing metadata and user progress)
- **AI/ML (Optional)**: TensorFlow.js or OpenCV for intelligent image categorization
